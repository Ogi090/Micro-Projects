# Task explanation
I'm gonna create a few pannels and then style them so each have a background image and then with litle bit of JS, im gonna change the class to be active when clicked and be expanded upon with CSS transition.

# CSS focused  

Styling the panel is 80% of it all

# JS

20% is click on panel change (class manipulation)
